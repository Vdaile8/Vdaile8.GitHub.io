<br><br>

This case study provided by Data Career Jumpstart challenged me with finding key insights from a data set derived from a delivery service named iFood.
<br><br>
Below are the questions that I was looking to answer:
<br><br>

<br><br>
-What month does this delivery service receive their most new members?
<br><br>
-How does the customer's income affect the total amount they typically spend on food?
<br><br>
-How did Campaign 6 perform?
